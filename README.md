# OBS Chapter Marker Cleaner for DaVinci Resolve

This Python script automates the cleanup of chapter markers generated by OBS Studio within DaVinci Resolve.  It streamlines the process of converting noisy clip markers into clean, sequentially numbered timeline markers, and then converts them back to clip markers on the main video track.  This is particularly useful when recording long sessions with OBS and using chapter markers for easy navigation and editing in Resolve.

## Problem

When recording with OBS and using its chapter marker feature, Resolve imports these markers as *clip markers* on *every* clip on the timeline (including audio, nested timelines, etc.).  This creates a very cluttered marker view and makes it difficult to navigate.  Manually cleaning these up is tedious and time-consuming.

## Solution

This script provides a one-click solution to:

1.  **Consolidate Clip Markers to Timeline Markers:**  All clip markers on selected clips are extracted and converted into timeline markers.
2.  **Rename and Number:** The timeline markers are sequentially numbered and renamed in the format:  `[Number] - [Original Timestamp]`.  For example: `1 - 00:00:00`, `2 - 00:15:32`, etc.
3.  **Remove Redundant Clip Markers:** All original clip markers from *all* clips on the timeline are deleted, leaving only the clean timeline markers.
4. Transfer to Video Track:** The script will take the timeline markers and add them back to the first video track as clip markers.

## Requirements

*   **DaVinci Resolve (Studio / Maybe works on Free? I haven't tried that):** Version 17 or later is recommended (though it may work on earlier versions that support the Resolve API).
*   **Python 3.6 or later:**  The script is written in Python and requires a compatible interpreter.  No external Python libraries are needed; it relies solely on the Resolve API.
*  **DaVinci Resolve Scripting API Access:** Ensure that Resolve's scripting API is enabled. This is usually enabled by default, but double-check in Resolve's preferences if you encounter issues.  (Preferences -> System -> General -> External Scripting Using -> Local/Network)

## Installation

1.  **Download:** Download the `obs_marker_cleaner.py` script from this repository.  You can clone the repository or simply download the single file.
2.  **Place in Resolve Script Folder:**  Place the `obs_marker_cleaner.py` file in the appropriate Resolve scripts folder.  The location varies depending on your operating system:

    *   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Edit\`
    *   **macOS:** `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Edit/`
    *   **Linux:** `$HOME/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/Fusion/Scripts/Edit/`  (or `/opt/resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Edit/` if installed system-wide)

    If the `Edit` folder doesn't exist within the `Scripts` folder, create it.
3. **Restart Resolve:** Restart DaVinci Resolve for the script to be recognized.
